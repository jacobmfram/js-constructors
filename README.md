Week 11 HW advanced javascript assignment

Please note that I have all my function in one javascript file instead of 3. I was having difficulty merging the modules and this is simply where I'm at with this assignment at the time it is due. For similar reasons the end-game message is producing an error message. I plan to study these and resolve going forward. Otherwise, the general game function works.
